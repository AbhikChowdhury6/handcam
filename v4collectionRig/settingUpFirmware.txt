First flash this os on a 128GB SD card with the latest rasbian version available using baleinda etcher

Plug it into a Ubuntu linux computer 

two drives should now be available boot and rootfs

move into the boot directory and create an empty folder named ssh (this will allow you to ssh once it's connected to your wifi)

now move into the other drive that should have been mounted called rootfs

edit the file /etc/wpa-supplicant/wpa-supplicant.conf adding the following lines, you can paste the network section multiple times for diffrent networks

""" TODO update
country=US

network={
    ssid="<your_wifi_name"
    psk=<your_wifi_password>

}

"""

now exit the folder and eject either of the drives and then remove the card

make sure wifi network is on

plug the SD card into your pi and connect it to power

after about 30 seconds the green activity LED on the PI should calm down and it should be connected to your network

On your Ubuntu linux computer install the program arp-scan using the command

# sudo apt-get install arp-scan

with your laptop connected to the same wifi network as the pi use arp-scan to search for the pi with the following command

# sudo arp-scan -l

you should see the pi on the network with this, ssh into the pi with this command (default password is "raspberry")

# ssh pi@<your_pi_ip>

now that you are logged in run this command to configure the pi

#sudo raspi-config

you should see a menu, in network update the hostname to be fitting of what the device will be used for (ex. handcamTestPi3)

also update the password now, and navigate to the interfaces menu option where you will enable the camera and I2c

exit the program and the pi should reboot

ssh back in and run this command to update the OS (caution may use 400MB of data)

# sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

install git

# sudo apt-get install git

clone the repo TODO

#git clone <repo_name>

in the repo navigate to the v4collectionRig folder

run setup.sh

sudo ./setup.sh

reboot and your device should bee working
