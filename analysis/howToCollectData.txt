make a folder for the trial name and move into it
call demographic information from that folder

put on device

ssh into both pi's

/////Calibration
run StreamVideo.sh
    top pi add args
        2222 -rot 270
    bottom pi add args
        2223 -vf -hf -rot 90
check to see if horizon is level

plug the side arduino into your computer and run 
    sudo python liveSerialGraph.py /dev/ttyUSB0 p1 p2 p3
        replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with the location on your machine if neccisary
have them open and close their hand and check if graphed values change

/////Capture
run on the bottom pi
    bash handcam/videoCap.sh TRIAL_NAME -vf -hf -rot 90

run on the top pi
    bash handcam/videoCapture.sh TRIAL_NAME -rot 270 &
    python handcam/logSerialPressure.py TRIAL_NAME &
    python3 handcam/BNOLogging.py TRIAL_NAME 

reapeat the BNO command until it works, it might take a good number of tries (>30)

note the process numbers on the top pi so we can kill them once the trial is done

start live tagging program from the trial name directory

for every exersize specify the experement type and the object
press enter when prompetd to indecate the start of the experment and again after

after all experements are over exit and kill all of the programs and consolidate the data
    move bottom cam video to computer

    move top cam video, IMU data, and pressure data to computer

    move the data from the pi's to the folder with the trial numbers



later run split files command passing in the location of your trial folder
